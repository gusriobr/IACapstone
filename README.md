# Use Case
I workd in a goberment body in a region of Spain that provides services and IT assistance to farmers, and we are specillay focused on developing decission support tools for different agricultural purposes. In one of this tools, it would be in a great help to have a model that could predict the next year land usage for a given area.
As a first attempt, we gathered the last 9 years history for around 2M points tagging for each year the crop code, hoping that we can apply some LSTM network to predict the next year crop code.
